Once upon a time in a bustling marketplace in India, there lived a young boy named Raju. Raju was a clever lad who loved to help his father at their fruit stand. One sunny morning, as Raju arranged the vibrant fruits neatly on the display, his friend Meena approached him, looking puzzled.

"Raju, can you help me understand subtraction?" Meena asked with a furrowed brow.

Raju grinned, always eager to share his knowledge. "Of course, Meena! Let me tell you a story that will make subtraction as easy as eating mangoes on a hot summer day."

Meena's eyes sparkled with anticipation as Raju began his tale.

"Once upon a time, there was a mischievous monkey named Chintu who loved to play pranks on the villagers. One day, Chintu sneaked into the village mango orchard and plucked ten juicy mangoes from the trees."

Meena nodded, picturing the scene in her mind.

"Now," Raju continued, "imagine the mango farmer, who was counting his mangoes and realized that ten were missing! He scratched his head and thought, 'Hmm... how many mangoes are left now?'"

Meena thought for a moment before replying, "Well, if ten mangoes were taken, then there must be fewer mangoes left."

"Exactly!" Raju exclaimed. "So, let's subtract the mangoes Chintu took from the total number of mangoes in the orchard."

Raju drew ten mangoes on the ground with a stick, and Meena watched attentively.

"Now, let's count how many mangoes are left," Raju said, erasing the ten mangoes one by one. "We had ten mangoes, and Chintu took them away. So, if we erase one mango at a time, we can see how many are left."

Meena counted along with Raju, "Nine... eight... seven... six..."

As they counted, Meena's face lit up with understanding. "So, subtraction is like taking away things from a group to find out how many are left!"

"Exactly, Meena!" Raju exclaimed, delighted with her quick understanding. "Subtraction helps us find out how much is left after we've taken something away. Just like in our mango story, we found out how many mangoes were left after Chintu took ten."

Meena beamed with newfound confidence. "Thank you, Raju! Now I understand subtraction much better."

Raju grinned, happy to have helped his friend grasp the concept. Together, they continued arranging the fruits at the stand, their minds filled with the colorful world of numbers and the sweet taste of mangoes. And from that day on, Meena never looked at subtraction the same way again, thanks to Raju's imaginative storytelling.
